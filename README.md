# Churn_Project


We received the data we used in this project in a raw form from the game company names “Apps Games” located in Ankara.

We cannot share all data due to confidentiality agreements.

The most important detail about the data we have was that no manipulations were made on it. So there was a lot of work to be done on it.

Our goal was to create a model that predicts whether the player will stay in the game after the 7th day.
